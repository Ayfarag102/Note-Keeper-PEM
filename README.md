Note Keeping with a spice of priority and emotional intelligence [management *per se*]

In the digital age we currently live in, people have become so occupied that [their] time [is at loss, and] has become a very lost asset leading to the lack of two factors: 1. priority, and 2. emotion.

It is appropriate that people realize that managing their time is better maintained, based on priority and their emotions, rather than just based on a time schedule.

Having learned in college that priority has 4 levels:
| Level | Description
| --- | --- |
| `1.` | Urgent & Important |
| `2.` | Urgent but Not Important |
| `3.` | Not Urgent but Important |
| `4.` | Not Urgent & Not Important |


| Level | Urgent? | Important? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1.` | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| `2.` | ✔️ |  ❌ |
| `3.` | ❌ | ✔️ |
| `4.` | ❌ | ❌ |

And emotions play a great role with it comes to prioritized tasks, that they complete tasks on the basis of how they feel about these tasks, so they take care of it accordingly. 


This simple (and soon to be upgraded) application will help user clients manage their lives without having to hesitate about their time, as long as one does the task they need to do with a sense of worth, betterment, and accomplishment about themselves.
